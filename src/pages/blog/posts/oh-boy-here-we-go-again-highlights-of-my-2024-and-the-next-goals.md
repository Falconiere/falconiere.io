In 2024, I failed again on my New Year's resolutions, like getting rich or hitting the gym (even though I worked out a lot ), but I accomplished a few things. Let's get started. 
#### My daughter
My daughter was born in July precisely. I never imagined how being a father would change my life in many ways. It's hard to describe the feeling I have every day. It's like falling in love again and again with the same little one. It made me stronger, more responsible, and happier.  Oh boy, the best feeling ever. 
#### Work and side-projects
The other good thing is that in 2024, I also fell in love with my profession. I was unmotivated and without direction, but I found my way and greatly enjoyed my job again! Thank you, my teammates. 

Also, I finally put a project online ([codafolks](codafolks.com), still in progress), started building more projects, and learned a lot. These projects were not just about work; they were about my passion. I poured my heart and soul into them, and the satisfaction I got from seeing them come to life was unparalleled. That feels so good.  
#### Knout Depression 
Well, not everything was entirely good, you guys don't know, but I was fighting against depression for so long (about 15 years, precisely), and I thought I would never win. Yup, this is a little dark subject of my life. But now, I feel confident about sharing with everyone because I am finally cured, at least temporarily. 

I know depression has cycles, and we never know when the next cycle will come. It was a long and arduous journey, filled with ups and downs, but I never gave up. I sought help, I tried different treatments, and I kept pushing forward. And now, I can proudly say that I've overcome it.  I can finally tell I am more than happier! And, of course, my wife and daughter have a huge part in this. 

#### Workout
I haven't gotten into the best shape yet but have been consistent at the gym. I have lost about 11 kilograms (75 kilograms now) and gained more muscle. I still have work to achieve my dream body, but I am close. 

#### New Home
So, by the end of 2024, we moved to a new house‚Äîa bigger house with more rooms and a beautiful view. Oh gosh, I love it! This place makes me more comfortable. I have space to be creative and achieve my goals. 
#### Continue With Good Habits
Well, 2025 is here, and I will do my best to accomplish my dreams, get all the projects from the paper and make them real. For that, I will be continuing with good habits,  so here are a couple of things I will be doing this year to achieve my goals: 

* I will continue spending quality time with my wife and daughter as much as possible (I wish I could spend much more time with them). I love them so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è
* I will continue learning to improve my professional, technical, and communication skills. 
* I will build better products and help my team to grow at my job.
* I will share more about things beyond my job. I enjoy various activities, such as playing guitar or reading sci-fi books, and I want to share that part of myself. 
* I will write more posts for my personal (website)[https://falconiere.io]
* I will keep going to the gym and be healthier physically and mentally. 

#### Goals
Every year, I set goals to pursue, and most of the time, I fail to achieve some of them, which is fine. The important thing is that you never have to give up unless you have something impossible; that is obvious.  So, here are my goals for 2025: 

* Make a post for [falconiere.io](https://falconiere.io)  every two weeks.
* Make a post for [codafolks](https://codafolks.com) every two weeks.
* Make at least one project profitable from [codafolks](https://codafolks.com)
* Monetise my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@falconiere).
* Make one international travel. 
* Buy a new house

I know these goals are too ambitious, but that is what moves me towards success or my definition of success.  

I could write much more about my projects and personal life in the post, but I will do it later. If you reach out, please let me know what you think. See ya ‚úåüèΩ
