Hi! my name is Falconiere; I'm from Brazil and work as a software developer.

I've been working remotely for almost four years, and as a software developer, finding remote work wasn't difficult. The tech industry offers plenty of opportunities.

I was thrilled when I got my first remote job. The first few months were smooth sailing. However, I eventually began feeling burnt out because I struggled to manage my free time.

Time management is crucial when working remotely. Since we're not commuting or dealing with traffic, and we have flexible schedules, it's easy to fall into the trap of procrastination and working late into the night. I'll be honest—even after years, I still struggle with procrastination, but I've made significant progress. I've created a workspace that helps me maintain productivity. Having a dedicated home office and a consistent routine is essential. This setup is crucial for anyone considering remote work.

Remote work has also transformed my financial situation. Working from home reduces expenses like transportation and meals out. These savings create opportunities for investment. I've invested a portion of my earnings, which has increased my financial security. This has enabled me to help my family, maintain good health insurance, and more.

While money matters, one of the best aspects of working from home is the reduced stress. You'll sleep better and have time for exercise—something I've recently started. You can spend more time with family and friends, enjoy hobbies like gaming, and focus on your well-being.

Though working from home offers many advantages, it does present challenges. During the pandemic, for instance, I experienced burnout from being house-bound continuously. Still, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.
