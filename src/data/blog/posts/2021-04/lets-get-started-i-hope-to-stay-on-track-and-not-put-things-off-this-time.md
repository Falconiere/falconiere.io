Did you imagine how to build your own business? I always do. The reason most of the time is financial freedom. Currently, I work for more or less 12 hours per day. I calculated that I could retire before my 40s with this number of hours.

I am now 28 years old, and I feel as though I wasted my twenties. It seems too late to create something new. However, I still hope to build something I can be proud of.

But having hope is not enough. I need to work hard and smartly.

So, I will start my own business. Fortunately, the internet makes it easier to earn passive income. I can create content for the web, such as a YouTube channel or write articles. It isn’t as simple as it appears, but I believe I can build something with a bit of effort.

I will begin by writing articles as it only requires a computer with internet access and a few ideas. I intend to discuss my job, which is software development. I hope to avoid making it dull, as software is a subject that can be complex and difficult to capture people’s attention.

This is my first article here, and I would like to share my progress. It’s difficult to maintain motivation, and I believe that writing it down could enhance the likelihood of not procrastinating on my dreams. Thank you so much for reading this article.
