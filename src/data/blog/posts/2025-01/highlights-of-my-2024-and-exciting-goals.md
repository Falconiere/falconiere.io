In 2024, I failed again on my New Year's resolutions, such as getting rich or hitting the gym (even though I worked out a lot), but I accomplished a few things. Let's get started.
#### My daughter
My daughter was born in June. I never imagined how being a father would change my life in so many ways. It's hard to describe the feeling I have every day. It's like falling in love again and again with the same little one. It has made me stronger, more responsible, and happier. Oh boy, it's the best feeling ever. 
#### Work and side-projects
Another positive aspect is that in 2024, I also developed a deep affection for my profession. I was unmotivated and without direction, but I found my way and once again greatly enjoyed my job. Thank you, my teammates. 

Additionally, I finally launched a project (Codafolks, which is still in progress), started building more projects, and learned a great deal. These projects were not just about work; they were about my passion. I poured my heart and soul into them, and the satisfaction I got from seeing them come to life was unparalleled. That feels so good.  
#### Knout Depression 
Well, not everything was entirely good, you guys don't know, but I was fighting against depression for so long (about 15 years), and I thought I would never win. Yup, this is a little dark subject in my life. However, I now feel confident about sharing with everyone because I am finally cured, at least for the time being. 

I know depression has cycles, and we never know when the next cycle will come. It was a long and arduous journey, filled with ups and downs, but I never gave up. I sought help, I tried different treatments, and I kept pushing forward. And now, I can proudly say that I've overcome it.  I can finally tell I am more than happy! And, of course, my wife and daughter have a huge part in this. 
#### Workout
I haven't reached my best shape yet, but I have been consistent at the gym. I have lost about 11 kilograms (now weighing 75 kilograms) and gained more muscle. I still have work to achieve my dream body, but I am close. 
#### New Home
By the end of 2024, we had moved to a new house‚Äîa larger home with more rooms and a beautiful view. Oh gosh, I love it! This place makes me more comfortable. I have space to be creative and achieve my goals. 
#### Continue With Good Habits
Well, 2025 is here, and I will do my best to accomplish my dreams, bring all the projects from the paper to life, and make them a reality. For that, I will be continuing with good habits,  so here are a couple of things I will be doing this year to achieve my goals: 

* I will continue to spend quality time with my wife and daughter as much as possible (I wish I could spend even more time with them). I love them so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è
* I will continue to learn and improve my professional, technical, and communication skills. 
* I will build better products and help my team grow in my current role.
* I will share more about things beyond my job. I enjoy various activities, such as playing the guitar or reading science fiction books, and I want to share that part of myself. 
* I will write more posts for my <a href="https://falconiere.io" target="_blank">website</a>.
* I will continue to visit the gym and strive to improve my health, both physically and mentally. 
#### Goals
Every year, I set goals to pursue, and most of the time, I fail to achieve some of them, which is fine. The important thing is that you never have to give up unless you have something impossible; that is obvious. So, here are my goals for 2025: 

* Make a post for <a href="https://falconiere.io" target="_blank">falconiere.io</a> every two weeks.
* Make a post for <a href="https://codafolks.com" target="_blank">codafolks.com</a>  every month.
* Monetise my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@falconiere" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
* Make one international travel. 
* Buy a new house.

I know these goals are too ambitious, but that is what drives me towards success, or at least my definition of it.  
I could write much more about my projects and personal life in the post, but I will do it later. If you reach out, please let me know your thoughts. See ya ‚úåüèΩ
