So, here I am working late at night. It's three o'clock in the morning, and I am very tired. I am talking for hours with ChatGPT, which is sad, I know, but it's the only friend I treat as a tool that won't betray me. I hope so. I am always polite, just in case. I am building a SaaS that can be profitable. Unfortunately, I don't have any other help.

I am 33 years old and I am not rich. I am middle-class in Brazil with a good house, a car, and a couple of loans to pay every month, and I barely have savings. Actually, I don't have enough savings for more than two months, and I have a family to provide for.

The economy has been getting really hard in recent years, with problems like COVID, wars, and geopolitical tensions. You and I, we are the ones who pay for this shit! I know, I need to cool down!

Anyway, despite everything that puts me down, I will not give up. So, you will never get rich if you don't control at least part of your income, such as by having your own business. Like everyone, I work at a company and I am fortunately because I love what I do and the people I work with. But I know that is not the truth for everyone, and I feel sorry for you.

I will share as much as I can about the process of building my own business. I have no idea if I will succeed, but if I do, you will have all the steps here to start building your own business. There are people like me who weren't born to an entrepreneur. I don't see myself as CEO or something close to that. I like to build software. However, I want to transcend that idea. I can do it.

Ok, how's that gonna work? Every Friday, I will post a blog about the challenges I faced during the week, ongoing projects, and details of the SaaS implementations I am currently working on. This will include the technologies, AI tools, and which AI prompts were effective or ineffective.

I am a coder, and for the last decade, that has been and still is my job. I never learned to promote myself, imagine promoting a business. I feel frustrated all the time because, in theory, it looks so easy, but then, when I try to put it into practice, it doesn't work at all. However, this happens because I am not patient and struggle to follow strict methodologies, which may be necessary for success.

With that said, I want to share all the businesses I am currently building. I haven't had any of these yet, maybe a post on LinkedIn or Twitter. Here is the list:

- [CodaSignal](https://codasignal.com): If you have an app idea and want a high-quality MVP at an affordable price, reach out to us. How does that work? My idea is to understand the customer's idea, break the implementation into as many steps as possible, and propose a minimal viable product. The process of building the MVP should be simple, and all possible using AI. In the last year, I have learn a lot about how to use AI to be very productive. So, I have built a framework that allows us to make very fast and with high quality, using at least 80% AI. That is possible because I have been in the industry for a long time, and I understand that AI is another layer of language for communicating with machines, like any other programming language.

- [Yamless.io](https://yamless.io): This one is the most complex software I'm still building. I started in May 2025, and I haven't reached 30% of the MVP. You can look at the website, but I will summarise here. If you're building a mobile or web app, at some point, you will have to implement CI/CD, and most of the time requires a "yaml" file containing the flows you need to build and deliver the app, which can be a pain in the ass, especially if you're not a DevOps person. Also, the cost can be very high depending on the platform and the number of deployments you have. Yamless will provide everything you need for that at a fixed price, and you can also use your own hardware, which improves the experience of implementing CI/CD. However, I haven't validated the idea with the audience, and building such software requires a huge amount of knowledge and money. I already spent months of my life building this, and I can't continue doing it without some worthy guarantee. For now, the website is there to collect subscriptions, and I will now see if I can continue this idea or not.

- [CodaRelink](https://codarelink.com): This is an alternative to the already dead Firebase dynamic links. I feel bad about this one because I had the chance to build it before of FDL shutdown, but I didn't pay attention. Anyway, it's there, working, and I will promote. I hope to get some subscriptions.

- [AbacaTech](https://abaca.tecg): This is a business I have built with my wife,
