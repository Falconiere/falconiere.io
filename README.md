## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

## Obsidian → Repo Sync (Blog & Assets)

If you keep your blog posts and assets inside an Obsidian vault and pointed this repo to them via symlinks (e.g. `src/data/assets` and `src/data/blog/posts`), Git will only track the symlinks, not the files they point to. To make the files themselves tracked in this repo, use the sync script:

- One‑time migration: this imports the content from the current symlink targets and replaces the symlinks with real folders that Git can track.

  - `yarn sync:obsidian`

- After migration, consider inverting the symlinks: create symlinks inside your Obsidian vault that point back into this repository (to `src/data/assets` and `src/data/blog/posts`). That way, this repo remains the source of truth and Obsidian can still read/write those files.

Notes:
- The script reads optional ignore patterns from `.assetsignore` (one filename per line). `.DS_Store` and `.obsidian` are ignored by default.
- No network access is required; this only copies from local symlink targets.
